## Overview

Sass Nature is a simplistic and responsive design for a tours and travels website. It has some cool animations, gradients used over background images, nice hover effects on buttons, fancy navigation with cool effects and a lot of other cool styling effects. 

## Sass Intro

**Sass makes CSS fun and quick**. Sass is an extension of CSS, adding nested rules, variables, mixins, selector inheritance, and more. It's translated to well-formatted, standard CSS using the command line tool or a plugin for your
build system.
